## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character from a hyper-efficient, sensor-monitored Enclave spends their first night in the bothy, detailing their sensory overload and slow attunement to a different rhythm.
- Compose a series of journal entries from Alistair Coe, the planner, as his certainty about 'improvement' erodes over weeks of observation, focusing on a single, inexplicable detail that won't fit his models.
- Imagine a dialogue between Eilidh and a young engineer sent to install a water turbine. She doesn't argue against it, but asks a series of simple, practical questions about maintenance, sourcing parts, and long-term effects that reveal the proposal's fragility.
- Write the myth or local story Ruaridh would tell about the 'hinge hour'—the time between day and night—and how it relates to the book's central conflict between change and permanence.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'Resilience Index' system that quantifies not efficiency or output, but stability, redundancy, and low-entropy maintenance—a tool to measure the strength of Eilidh's way of life on its own terms.
- Create a procedural generator for 'functional beauty': an algorithm that produces descriptions of tools, shelters, or objects where form is derived strictly from documented material constraints and ergonomic need, mirroring the novel's aesthetic.
